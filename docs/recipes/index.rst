FiftyOne turbocharges your current workflows, transforming hours of scripting
into minutes so that you can focus on your models!

Browse the *recipes* below to see how you can leverage FiftyOne to enhance key
parts of your machine learning workflows.

.. :rubric: :doc:`Dataset Audit <data_audit>`

.. Browse your dataset and audit a subset in order to estimate the accuracy of
.. the labels. Search by label and track which samples were audited easily
.. using **FiftyOne**.

.. :rubric: :doc:`Visualize prediction errors <visualize_errors>`

.. Have a model? Rapidly hone in on which samples it is making errors on and
.. visually inspect for unexpected factors and interesting patterns.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Remove duplicate images from a dataset<image_deduplication>`

Turn your data into a `FiftyOne Dataset` and automatically find and remove
duplicate and near-duplicate images from your dataset.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Add model predictions to a datasets<model_inference>`

Add FiftyOne to your model training and analysis loop to visualize and analyze
your model's predictions.
