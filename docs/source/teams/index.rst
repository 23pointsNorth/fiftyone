FiftyOne Teams
===================

Welcome to the FiftyOne Teams Docs!

FiftyOne Teams enables multiple users to securely collaborate on the same datasets and models, either on-premises or in the cloud, all built on top of the open source FiftyOne workflows that you're already relying on.

All documentation at https://fiftyone.ai is fully applicable to FiftyOne Teams deployments, as Teams is backwards compatible with open source FiftyOne.
