.. note::

  These examples are intended to be run from an interactive Python session, and
  the app will quit when the Python process exits. If you are using the app from
  a non-interactive Python script, you may want to add a call to
  :meth:`session.wait() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.wait>` to keep the app
  open until you close it manually.
