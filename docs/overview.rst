# FiftyOne Overview

Teaser video that summarizes a typical usage of FiftyOne
- visualize data
- query, sort, tag
- compute useful metrics like mistakedness, uniqueness

Value Proposition: What problems are you solving for me?
1. Your data has problems that are holding back the performance of your models
2. Dataset wrangling is tedious, laborious, and not-sexy. At the same time, gaining an intuitive understanding of your data is key to improving your model’s performance
3. ROI for Data Scientists: Improving your data diversity is the biggest return on investment that you can make to improving the accuracy/performance of your model. - this needs to be emphasized - that FiftyONe is for data scientists - it’s not just about data wrangling - it’s for data scientists to help them build better models by making data interaction more accessible]
