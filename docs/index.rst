FiftyOne
========

    *"Data is king in the artificial intelligence world."*

If you are looking to boost your model performance, chances are improving
dataset quality is going to provide the highest return on investment.

**FiftyOne** is a cutting-edge, Python-based tool for the visual data scientist
to help in creating valuable and diverse datasets. Work efficiently to achieve
better models and more meaningful metrics.

    *"Become one with the data."*

FiftyOne does more than improve your dataset; it gets you closer to your data.
Rapidly gain insight by visualizing samples overlayed with with dynamic and
queryable fields such as ground truth/prediction labels, tags (dataset splits)
and much more!

The dataset should be dynamic and evolving part of the machine learning "code".
This means:

1. adding new samples that increase diversity
2. removing redundant samples that do not benefit performance and bloat the
   dataset unnecessarily
3. modifying labels due to annotation mistakes, change in schema, or something
   else

Capabilities
____________

FiftyOne provides advanced capabilities that will turbocharge your
machine learning workflow.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Detection of Annotation Mistakes<tutorials/label_mistakes/README>`:

Automatically detect label annotation mistakes.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Remove Redundant Images<tutorials/uniqueness/README>`:

Find and remove similar samples in your dataset to reduce
redundancy.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Bootstrap A Training Dataset<tutorials/???.ipynb>`:

Bootstrap your training dataset with raw images.

.. rubric:: :doc:`Add Optimal New Samples<tutorials/???.ipynb>`:

performance.

Concepts
________

.. rubric:: :doc:`FiftyOne Core Library<user_guide/basics>`:

The **Core Library** provides a lightweight and structured yet dynamic dataset
representation. Efficiently query and manipulate your dataset by adding custom
tags, model predictions and more.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import fiftyone as fo

   dataset = fo.Dataset(name="my_dataset")
   sample = fo.Sample(filepath="path/to/img.png")
   dataset.add_sample(sample)
   sample.tags += ["train"]
   sample["integer_field"] = 51
   view = dataset.view().match_tag("test").sort_by("integer_field")[5:10]
   for sample in view:
       ...

.. rubric:: :doc:`Interactive Visual App<user_guide/app>`:

The **App** makes it easy to rapidly gain intuitions. Visualize labels,
bounding boxes and segmentations overlayed on the samples and sort, query and
slice your dataset into any aspect you need.

.. rubric:: :doc:`FiftyOne Brain<user_guide/brain>`:

The **Brain** provides powerful :ref:`capabilities` for modifying datasets in
ways that will best improve model performance.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import fiftyone.brain as fob

   fob.compute_uniqueness(dataset)
   rank_view = dataset.view().sort_by("uniqueness")
