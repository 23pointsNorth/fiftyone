FiftyOne
========

*Data is king in the modern age of deep learning.*

If you are looking to boost your model performance, chances are improving
dataset quality is going to provide the highest return on investment.

Is bad data holding back the performance of your models? No? Are you sure?? Or
are you being overly optimistic?

**FiftyOne** is a cutting-edge, Python-based tool for the visual data scientist
to help in creating valuable and diverse datasets. Work efficiently to achieve
better models and clearer and more meaningful evaluation results.

What are some typical things I may be trying to achieve with FiftyOne?

Improving your dataset! The dataset should be dynamic and evolving part of the
machine learning "code". This means:

1. adding new samples that increase diversity
2. removing redundant samples that do not benefit performance and bloat the
   dataset unnecessarily
3. modifying labels due to annotation mistakes, change in schema, or something else
