Value Proposition: What problems are you solving for me?

1. Your data has problems that are holding back the performance of your models
2. Dataset wrangling is tedious, laborious, and not-sexy. At the same time,
   gaining an intuitive understanding of your data is key to improving your
   model’s performance
3. ROI for Data Scientists: Improving your data diversity is the biggest return
   on investment that you can make to improving the accuracy/performance of
   your model. - this needs to be emphasized - that FiftyONe is for data
   scientists - it’s not just about data wrangling - it’s for data scientists
   to help them build better models by making data interaction more accessible]
