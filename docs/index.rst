FiftyOne
========

In the modern age of deep learning, **quality data** is quickly becoming the
most important factor to successful machine learning. And unlike those neatly
curated research datasets, real world problems means data that is partially
labeled, unbalanced, mislabeled, misrepresentative...you name it.

Is bad data holding back the performance of your models?

If you answered no, are you sure? Or are you being overly optimistic?

For the vast majority of cases, improving dataset quality is going to be the
highest return on investment for boosting model performance. This could mean
many things, such as:

1. adding new samples that increase diversity
2. removing redundant samples that do not benefit performance and bloat the
   dataset unnecessarily
3. modifying labels due to annotation mistakes

It is time to start seeing the dataset as a dynamic and evolving part of the
machine learning "code", and this is where **FiftyOne** comes in.

**FiftyOne** is a cutting-edge, Python-based tool for the visual data scientist
to help in creating valuable and diverse datasets. **FiftyOne**:

* provides powerful capabilities for understanding and modifying datasets
  in ways that will best improve model performance
* facilitates good practice and organization in shepherding data
* makes it easy to rapidly gain intuitions and efficiently wrangle data

Improving your dataset means better models, clearer and more meaningful
evaluation results and a more efficient means to all of this.
